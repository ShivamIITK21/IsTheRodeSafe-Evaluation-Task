# IsTheRodeSafe-Evaluation-Task
Evaluation task for summer project "Is The Road Safe" offered by Pclub IITK

Name - Shivam Sharma

Roll no. - 210983

B) This dataset is taken from the UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

C) Since the task of the model was to make a classification(wheather a person would make 50K year or not), I tried 4 different classfication models, Logistic regression, decision tree classificaion, random forest classificaion and K nearest neighbours classificaion. Amoung these I got the highest accuracy from Random Forest Classifier which was expected given the large size of the dataset. Apart from the high accuracy, Random Forest would be an ideal model for this dataset due to its robustness to overfitting.
